DescDetail: <<
yorick-ca provide the caget, caput and camonitor access to an epics database.
These tools are shaped on caget, caput and camonitor, so they are relatively
fast (much more so than the ezca implementation). I get average of 1ms exec
time for a simple caget for instance.

Do not forget to set the necessary environment variables. Here is an config
example:
poliahu% printenv | grep EPICS
PATH=[...]:/usr/local/epics/base/bin/darwin-ppc:/usr/local/epics/extensions/bin/darwin-ppc
EPICS_HOST_ARCH=darwin-ppc
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST=10.2.2.255
EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST=NO
EPICS=/usr/local/epics
<<
DescUsage: <<
See check.i for an example test suite.

First, set your environment. Here is an example of mine:
poliahu% printenv | grep EPICS
PATH=[...]:/usr/local/epics/base/bin/darwin-ppc:/usr/local/epics/extensions/bin/darwin-ppc
EPICS_HOST_ARCH=darwin-ppc
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST=10.2.2.255
EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST=NO
EPICS=/usr/local/epics

Second, you have first to modify check.i: change the pv names by some pv valid
in your local epics environement. 

Type "yorick -i check.i" in a terminal to run it.

DescPort: <<
This package will compile Yorick only on MacOSX 10.3.4 or later, because
of a bug in the system math library libm (part of /usr/lib/LibSystem.dylib)
in earlier versions of MacOSX 10.3.
